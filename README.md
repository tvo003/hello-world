# hello-world
This is going to be my first app I'm building.  I went to a boot camp, but I feel like I need to learn more. 

I'm very excited about learning new things. I know I will make mistakes, but I have to learn from them to get better.

I will be working/adding more projects to my account. I will see progress as I get better at coding, and my projects will look better and better by the project.
